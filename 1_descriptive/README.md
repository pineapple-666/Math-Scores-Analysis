# PSME_1_ Data Analysis

This repository contains R code for analyzing the PSME_1_.csv dataset. The script performs basic data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualizations for survey responses and math scores by district.

## Files
- `my_console.R`: Main R script for data analysis (cleaned and focused on PSME_1_.csv)
- `README.md`: This file
- `.gitignore`: (Recommended) Ignore unnecessary files
- `PSME_1_.csv`: (Not included if sensitive; see below)

## How to Use
1. Place `PSME_1_.csv` in the same directory as the R script.
2. Open `my_console.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Run the script to generate summary statistics and plots.

## Data Format
- The CSV should include at least the columns: `CAP04`, `DISTRICT`, and (optionally) `Math_Score_rounded`.
- `CAP04` is expected to be coded 1-5 (Likert scale).
- `DISTRICT` should be numeric (e.g., 11, 12, 13, 14).

## Requirements
- R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`


## Results and Example Plots

Below are example plots generated by the analysis scripts. You can view these images in the `Pictures` folder or include them in your reports and presentations.

### Example: Frequency Distribution of Math State Test Scores in District 12 and 13

![Figure 6: Frequency Distribution of Math State Test Scores in District 12 and 13](c:/Users/siming/Pictures/屏幕截图 2025-09-17 152856.png)

*Note: Math state test scores are scaled from raw scores and rounded to integers. District 12 N = 2,817. District 13 N = 1,549.*

### Additional Example Plots

You can add more plots by exporting them from R (e.g., using `ggsave()`), then referencing them in this README using Markdown:

```markdown
